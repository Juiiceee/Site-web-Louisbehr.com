		Allfeat is a blockchain dedicated to the <strong>musical industry</strong>.
		The theme of this Hackathon was the <strong>integration of music</strong> into <strong>blockchain</strong>.
		This blockchain allows to development in <strong>Rust</strong> or <strong>Solidity</strong>, because it’s <strong>EVM compatible</strong>.</br>
		I was in a team with 2 <strong>front-ends</strong> developers, 1 <strong>back-end</strong> developer, 1 <strong>UI/UX</strong> designer and 1 <strong>blockchain</strong> developer (myself).
		Our <strong>Sample</strong> project is designed to enable <strong>all types</strong> of <strong>content creators</strong> to use <strong>music</strong> of <strong>great artists</strong> for <strong>their creations</strong>.</br>
		For instance, an <strong>artist</strong> can put his music over-the-counter with a <strong>set price</strong>, allowing a buyer to <strong>acquire</strong> the <strong>rights</strong> to <strong>use its content</strong>.
		Once the buyer has purchased the right to use said music in its contents, he can <strong>link</strong> it to the <strong>URL</strong> of the content, <strong>getting</strong> the <strong>right to use it</strong>.
		This right to use is represented in a <strong>single use NFT</strong>, once the  <strong>NFT</strong> is linked to a  <strong>URL</strong>, it <strong>cannot</strong> be <strong>modified</strong>.`,

		So, I developed a little software in <strong>Python</strong> that uses a <strong>request API</strong> on <strong>StockX</strong>.
		I <strong>scraped</strong> the returned <strong>JSON file</strong> to extract the prices in my <strong>size</strong>,
		and it puts <strong>all the values</strong> in an <strong>.xls file</strong>.
		It also <strong>sends me an email</strong> with a <strong>graph showing the increases and decreases each week</strong>.`,

	  It was really cool to set it up,
	  managing both the <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software installation</strong>,
	  and realizing that we can <strong>generate money </strong>with our <strong>graphics cards</strong>.
	  I also had to manage <strong>power consumption</strong>, <strong>overclocking</strong>,
